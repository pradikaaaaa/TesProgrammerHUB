What is 'M'? In Indonesian language 'M' can be the first letter of many words. For instance: Malang (a city name), Masuk (enter), Mentari (sun), etc.

It's up to you to choose whatever the interpretation of the 'M' is..

However, one particular Indonesian word begins with M is 'Mudah' (easy). That's what this framework aims to be. This is just yet another PHP framework intended for any students want to learn Model-View-Controller design pattern with PHP.
